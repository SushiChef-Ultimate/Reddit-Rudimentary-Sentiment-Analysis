Commit 1:
    Connected to reddit API. We will be pulling from the economy subreddit

Commit 2:
    Figured out how to scrape data from reddit, put it into a list, transform it into something a databse can use, and exported it.
    The code now generates a table if it doesn't exist (only really runs the first time), and populates the table with data.
    We will be using Neon as our serverless database, since its free tier is accesible for someone in my position, and automatic scaling
    takes some responsibility from me.

Commit 3:
    Modified python file to continously populate NeonDB. Created a similar python file that deletes old info and replaces it with new info continously
    This will be useful when we eventually hit Neon's storage limit, but still want to up-to-date data.

    After further consideration, we will be automating use of these files on cloud, since populating the database locally
    can be somewhat cumbersome.

Commit 4:
    We will be utlizing AWS to continously deploy our project. Created a requirements.txt file so that AWS can download our
    libraries.

    Created a buildspec.yml for AWS lambda.
